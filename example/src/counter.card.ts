 *
 * ## Meta Card: Counter
 *
 * This file defines a **meta card** — a reusable, higher-level card that is
 * itself composed entirely of other Pihanga cards (primitive or meta). Meta
 * cards are the primary building block for complex, self-contained UI widgets
 * that can be independently developed, tested, and dropped into any Pihanga
 * application.
 *
 * ### Composition
 * The `Counter` meta card is assembled inside `CounterMapper` using three
 * standard `@pihanga2/shadcn` cards:
 *
 * - **`Stack`** — lays out its children in a horizontal row.
 * - **`Button`** (×2) — decrement ("−") and increment ("+") controls.
 * - **`Typography`** — displays the current count, re-evaluated reactively
 *   on every state change via a resolver function.
 *
 * Because `CounterMapper` receives a `registerCard` helper, child cards can
 * either be returned inline (anonymous) or pre-registered under a stable name
 * (e.g. `"plus"`) so they participate in Pihanga's card registry and can be
 * referenced elsewhere if needed.
 *
 * ### Event Re-Mapping
 * Each `Button` internally dispatches a low-level `onClicked` event. Inside
 * `CounterMapper` those clicks are **re-mapped** via `onClickedMapper` into
 * the semantically meaningful `COUNTER_ACTION.CHANGED` action — the only
 * event that leaks out of this meta card.
 *
 * ```
 * Button.onClicked  ──► onClickedMapper ──► COUNTER_ACTION.CHANGED
 *                                              { value: newCount }
 * ```
 *
 * Consumers of `Counter` never need to know about raw click events; they
 * simply listen with `onCounterChanged` and receive the updated numeric value.
 * This encapsulation mirrors the way React components emit domain-specific
 * callbacks rather than exposing DOM events.
 *
 * ### Independent Testability
 * Because `CounterMapper` is a plain function that returns a `PiCardDef`
 * tree, it can be unit-tested in isolation: supply mock `props` and a mock
 * `registerCard`, then assert on the returned card definition without
 * mounting a full Redux store or rendering to the DOM.
